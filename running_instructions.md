# instructions to run fetch rewards coding challenge code for fetch rewards

I coded this challenge in python 3.7.4. The code should include document_compare.py and cleanup_function.py along with 
the sample documents. Place all files the same folder for simplicity then run the document_compare.py.

When you run the document_compare.py, in the command prompt it should prompt you to give the first directory of a sample files 
then the second directory of a sample file. The program will then compare the two documents and give you a number
between 0 and 1 (0 being no matches, 1 being perfect match).
